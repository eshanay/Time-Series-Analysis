# Time-Series-Analysis
###This is an application of Time series analysis based solely on Time Domain Approach using R on a electricity consumption units dataset for my house from our electricity supplier's website (collected for each months over the past 5 years). I first took a logarithmic transformation of the data and then based on additive model assumption, searched for any potential trend, seasonal components and directly eliminated them without extracting separately.
Then using the irregular component, I modelled a multiplicative SARIMA on the data, to find the 12-step ahead forecast and then back-transform it using exponential function to predeict how much electricity units will be consumed(with a 1-s.e. confidence band) in my household within the next 12 months.
